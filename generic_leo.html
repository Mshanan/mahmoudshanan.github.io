							<p>The main aim of this project is to ”Design and develop an autonomous mobile robot (Leo Rover) capable of retrieving
								a randomly located cuboid object from an unknown indoor environment, and returning
								it to the starting point of the robot”. This is an ongoing group project, which is part of my MSc Robotic System Design unit. 
								<br/>I am particularly working on integrating the robot arm (PincherX 150) with the system, and developing its control algorithm.
								I was also assigned the role of planner and finisher; creating a plan for each semester, assigining resources, ensuring
								quality work, and meeting deadlines.</p>
							
							<p>The Leo rover is a stable and customisable mobile robot, that can be deployed indoors
								as well as outdoors, and withstand any environment. </p>

							<p9>Key Aspects</p9>
								<ul>
									<li>The Leo Rover software was developed to operate at the highest possible level of autonomy,
										ensuring limited to no human intervention during the mission. It includes motion and path planning algorithms, which are accompanied by SLAM.
										It also includes other low level controllers, and machine learning and computer vision algorithms, and was designed 
										and tested using ROS 2, Gazebo simulation, python, and C++.	</li>
									<li>The Leo Rover hardware consists of a Raspeberry Pi 4, an Intel NUC 12 Pro mini, and the LeoCore controller.
										The Raspberry Pi serves as an interface between
										the LeoCore Controller (controlling the motors) and the NUC (receiving sensor data and controlling
										robot arm). </li> 
								<li>The original Leo Rover was assembled and upgraded; a payload cell was designed, 3-D printed, and placed on top of the rover
									to fit a robotic manipulator, a depth camera, and a Lidar.</li>
								<li>The LiDAR and depth camera were integrated with the system, allowing the Leo Rover to navigate
									through an unknown environment, avoid obstacles, and locate a wooden cuboid object autonomously.</li>
								<li>The robotic manipulator was integrated with the system, allowing the Leo Rover to pick up the object, 
									and return it safely to the starting point of the robot.</li>
								</ul>
