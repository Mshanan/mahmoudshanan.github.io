							<p>The main aim of this project was to design an autonomous microcontroller-based buggy, which can autonomously
								follow a white line around a track using infrared sensors. It was part of my second year embedded systems
								group project during my bachelors. </p>

							<p> • DC motors were first characterised, and a gearbox ratio was then chosen according to the maximum torque required to 
								climb up slopes, while maintaining a relatively fast pace. <br />
								• Three different sensors were characterised and compared. The TCRT5000 (infrared sensor) was chosen due to its high
								dynamic range and low ambient current, meaning that the ambient light hardly affected the readings. <br />
								• The chassis of the buggy was designed on SolidWorks, and was lazer-cutted.  <br />• The sensor's circuit was designed
								and simulated on Multisim, tested on a stripboard, then a PCB was designed on Altium, and printed. <br />
								• The control algorithm of the buggy was written in C++ (Mbed library), using object-oriented
								programming methods to read data from the infrared sensors, and send control signals (PWM) to the DC motors 
								of the buggy, so forth performing 5 different manoeuvres: going forward, uphill, downhill, turning right and 
								left, and stopping.
