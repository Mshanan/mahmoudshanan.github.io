							<p>The aim of this project was to design a cascaded PID controller to control the pitch and yaw of both configurations
								of the Quanser Aero 2 platform (1-DOF Bi-copter and 2-DOF Helicopter), and evaluate the feasability of developing
								a new 2-DOF quadcopter configuration. The performance of PID control in UAVs was evaluated through hardware-in-loop simulation, using
								MATLAB/Simulink and QUARC real-time control software.<br />
							</p>
							<p>The Quanser Aero 2 is a fixed platform used in research and development of control systems for
							UAVs. It consists of two brushless DC motors and rotors generating thrust allowing the system to
							pitch and yaw. It is also equipped with 4 encoders, a gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer,
							measuring pitch and yaw angles, and rotor speed.

							<p9>Key Findings</p9>
							<p>• It was not possible to control both pitch and
								yaw simultaneously in the bi-copter configuration, unlike the helicopter configuration.<br />
								• Pitch control in both configurations was almost
								identical, with fast time response, low steady-state error, and small oscillations.<br /> 
								• For bi-copter
								yaw control, time response was thirty times slower than the helicopter as both rotors were
								horizontal compared to the helicopter where one rotor was vertical. <br />• Mathematical and
								mechanical approaches were proposed to attempt controlling the system as a quadcopter, yet
								they were both unsuccessful. This implied that the Quanser Aero 2 could not be controlled as a
								quadcopter.</p>
